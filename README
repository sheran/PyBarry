Hello and welcome to PyBarry!

The aim of this project is to write a Python module to take advantage of the functionality of the Barry (http://netdirect.ca/barry) library.  The Barry library allows Linux users to connect to and use their BlackBerry devices on Linux via USB.

To get started, checkout the source from SVN:

svn checkout http://pybarry.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pybarry-read-only

You will find the source code to the modules in the 'src' directory.

Presently I am working on three distinct modules:

PyBarry.simple -- a set of simple commands that you can run to get information from your BlackBerry
PyBarry.core -- provides access to a core set of the Barry Library functions
PyBarry.javaloader -- replicates the RIM JavaLoader functionality, only on Python

Requirements
============

You will need to have libbarry installed on your system to build or install PyBarry

Building/Installing
===================

Once you're happy with your source code, you can build and install it by typing in:

python setup.py install

Usage
=====

There will be a more comprehensive usage guide for you to follow on http://code.google.com/p/pybarry.  Look through the wikis there
